# Todo List Coursework
### Front-End

Here is the continuation of the coursework in which I previously created back-end API for.

## How to Run
You will have to run the API first to start it. You can always consume some other API, just rewrite the API variables in 'networking/Server.js'.

You also need to create a directory in "android" called 'local.properties', in that directory you need to add the Android SDK location on your machine.
For linux it looks like this "sdk.dir = /home/YOUR_USERNAME/Android/Sdk". Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username, by default it will download to home
when you installing AndroidStudio.
